Clone other people's directories and silently add makestuff to them.

Each directory has a repo, repo subdirectory, name

To deal with subdirs, we first clone things into "clones" (where we're not meant to look) and then link to their names. If we are using two subdirs from the same repo, these should generally be based on different clones
